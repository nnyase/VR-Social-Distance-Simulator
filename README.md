# VR-Social-Distance-Simulator
Collaborated with collegues to create a Virtual Reality application for Android in Unity that educates children how to social distance correctly in various areas such as malls, and bars.Â The focus was on human computer interaction and user centred design to produce a industry standard application.

Unfortunately, the simulator cannot be downloaded on github as the file is too large. Please email me at n.nyase@tilburguniversity.edu to upload and download the game to use on your phone and VR headset
